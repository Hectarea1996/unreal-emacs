# Unreal Emacs

This project is based on the [Unreal Emacs](https://gitlab.com/unrealemacs/ue.el) project by Manenko. Unfortunately, he can't improve his project right now so I'm doing this to muddle through. I'm not an Emacs package developer. I'm doing this for personal purposes. Almost every line of code was written by Manenko. I'm just changing some things that can be handy for ME. 

My code can be considered as being in the public domain.
